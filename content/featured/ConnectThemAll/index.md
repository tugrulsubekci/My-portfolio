I developed a mobile puzzle game with endless pop-connecting gameplay, vibration feedback, and Unity Ads integration. Using tools like Firebase, Appmetrica, and Airbridge, I tracked user behavior and performance. The game launched on Google Play with features like push notifications, in-app updates, and user reviews.
