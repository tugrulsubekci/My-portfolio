This project visualizes the part of Istanbul metro system using networkx and matplotlib. It includes the calculation of Euclidean distances between metro stations and draws the network graph with the stations and lines. The stations are represented by points on a Cartesian plane, and the metro lines are visualized as edges connecting these points.
