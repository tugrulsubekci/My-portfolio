Created my first 3D game inspired by Helix Jump, featuring enhanced gameplay with sliders, button animations, and Trail Renderer effects. Improved user experience by implementing data saving with Player Prefs and developed dynamic levels through procedural generation. This project significantly advanced my skills in 3D game development and innovative game mechanics.
